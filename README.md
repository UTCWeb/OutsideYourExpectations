# explore-utc
"Explore UTC" is a one-off, html-based marketing page with lots of movement and effects.

*******

Purpose

This is a recruitment tool used to increase student enrollment. It is an engaging and visuallly aesthetic page that integrates numerous UX features in order to appeal and capture the user's attention and promote the likelihood of conversion. It replaces the current Experience UTC page found here: https://webapp.utc.edu/digital/experience_utc/. It will be linked from the home page of www.utc.edu, but primarily it will be used for recruitment campaigns via QR codes. Upon the completion of moving some of its features to Drupal, this will become an internal Drupal page. It incorporates the brandbar v.2 code found at this repo: https://github.com/UTCWeb/utc-brandbar-html-only
